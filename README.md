# Avanti Store
Technical test conducted for the purpose of applying for the position of **Senior Frontend Developer** at [Galer√≠a Avanti](http://www.galeriaavanti.com/en/).

It was developed mainly using **Next.js 13** with **Typescript** and consisted of creating an e-commerce application using the Shopify API [https://mock.shop/](https://mock.shop/). This is a GraphQL API so I made use of [graphql-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) to do all the requests.

The project demo is available at [https://glistening-sunburst-fb3c17.netlify.app/](https://glistening-sunburst-fb3c17.netlify.app/)

## Application modules

- Landing page
- Product detail page
- Products Search page (Paginated)
- Products list by collections (Paginated)

Unit tests** were performed on the most important components that affected the main flow of the application.
